Georges Méliès

Marie-Georges-Jean Méliès (8 December 1861 – 21 January 1938) was a French illusionist, actor, and film director who led many technical 
and narrative developments in the earliest days of cinema. Méliès was well known for the use of special effects, popularizing such techniques 
as substitution splices, multiple exposures, time-lapse photography, dissolves, and hand-painted colour. He was also one of the first filmmakers 
to use storyboards. His films include A Trip to the Moon (1902) and The Impossible Voyage (1904), both involving strange, surreal journeys 
somewhat in the style of Jules Verne, and are considered among the most important early science fiction films, though their approach is closer 
to fantasy.
